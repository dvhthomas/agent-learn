# Reflection Pattern

## Concept

Reflection in the sense of self-reflection and self-improvement.

> Unlike a simple sequential chain where output is passed directly to the next step, or routing which chooses a path, reflection introduces a feedback loop. The agent doesn't just produce an output; it then examines that output (or the process that generated it), identifies potential issues or areas for improvement, and uses those insights to generate a better version or modify its future actions.

Whether it's a separate agent doing the reflection or not, the overall system has a 'meta' benefit:

> Reflection adds a layer of meta-cognition to agentic systems, enabling them to learn from their own outputs and processes, leading to more intelligent, reliable, and high-quality results.

## Reflection Pattern Diagram

Gulli talks about Producer-Consumer or Generator-Critic being a common implementation of the reflection pattern.
It avoids cognitive bias as separate agents with their own system prompts tend to product better results.
