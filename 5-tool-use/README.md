# Tool Use

LLMs are stuck in time.
Tool Use is the way to connect them to more current or specialized knowledge such as recent events or confidential organizational information.

Until recently this was mostly 'function calling' but now think in terms of generic 'tool calling'.

## Tool Use Design Pattern

    style Output fill:#e8f5e8
```

Most of the chapter described non-Model Context Protocol (MCP) ways of wiring up tools.
I think there's a section on MCP coming up, but MCP was probably just coming into being when the draft book was written.
Still, handy to know how to do things without MCP :smile:

## Frameworks

LangChain uses the `@tool` decorator to define tools that can be used by the agent. `create_tool_calling_agent` and AgentExecutor are used to build tool-using agents.

Google ADK includes some handy pre-built tools such as Google Search and Code Execution.

## LangChain Notes

I didn't understand why `agent_scratchpad` was needed and whether the specific name was important.
Some Claude searching led to this:

> `agent_scratchpad` is a special variable in LangChain's ChatPromptTemplate used for agent workflows. It's where the agent stores its intermediate reasoning steps, tool calls, and tool outputs as it works toward a final answer.
>
>Key points:
>
> 1. **Purpose**: Acts as the agent's "working memory" containing the conversation history between the agent and tools
> 2. **Format**: A list of alternating AI messages (tool calls) and tool messages (tool outputs)
> 3. **Usage**: Must be included as a placeholder in your prompt template
>
> Example:
> ```python
> from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
>
> prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
>     ("system", "You are a helpful assistant"),
>     ("user", "{input}"),
>    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="agent_scratchpad"),
> ])
> ```
>
> The scratchpad gets populated automatically by the AgentExecutor with the agent's tool usage history, allowing the LLM to see what actions it has already taken and their results.

That seems pretty odd: why isn't it just set up by the ChatPromptTemplate constructor instead of relying on the user to know about that magic variable?

### Nested Event Loops

I didn't understand what the `nest_asyncio` was for. Claude to the rescue!

`nest_asyncio.apply()` patches asyncio to allow nested event loops.

**The Problem**: By default, asyncio prevents running `asyncio.run()` or `loop.run_until_complete()` when an event loop is already running (raises `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running`).

**The Solution**: `nest_asyncio.apply()` removes this restriction by making the event loop reentrant.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Jupyter notebooks (which run their own event loop)
- Web servers
- GUI applications
- When calling async functions from sync code in environments with existing event loops

**Usage**:
```python
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()  # Patch applied globally

# Now you can use asyncio.run() even within existing event loops
```

**Caution**: This breaks asyncio's design principles and can cause task starvation if nested runs take too long, as outer tasks won't get execution time.



### Goofs

The script I wrote was originally called `langchain.py`.
After a bunch of head scratching and failed attempts, I realized that
the name conflicted with the `langchain` package :facepalm:
The file was renamed to `tool_agent.py` and the problem was solved.

I also forgot to annotate the `def search_information` function with the `@tool` decorator.

## CrewAI

The CrewAI SDK was used for the first time in this project.

### CrewAI Execution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Script
    participant Crew
    participant Agent
    participant Task
    participant Tool

    Note over User, Tool: Success Case (AAPL)
    User->>Script: Execute crewai-tools.py
    Script->>Agent: Create financial_analyst_agent with generic stock tools
    Script->>Task: Create task with specific request for AAPL
    Script->>Crew: Create crew with agent and task
    Script->>Crew: kickoff()
    
    Crew->>Agent: Assign task
    Agent->>Task: Read task description ("What is AAPL price?")
    Agent->>Tool: get_stock_price("AAPL")
    Tool-->>Agent: Return $178.15
    Agent->>Agent: Format response
    Agent-->>Crew: "The simulated stock price for AAPL is $178.15"
    Crew-->>Script: Return result
    Script-->>User: Display final result

    Note over User, Tool: Failure Case (AMZN)
    Script->>Task: Create task with specific request for AMZN
    Script->>Crew: Create new crew with agent and task
    Script->>Crew: kickoff()
    
    Crew->>Agent: Assign task
    Agent->>Task: Read task description ("What is AMZN price?")
    Agent->>Tool: get_stock_price("AMZN")
    Tool->>Tool: Check simulated_prices dict
    Tool-->>Agent: ValueError: "Simulated price for ticker 'AMZN' not found"
    Agent->>Agent: Handle exception and format error response
    Agent-->>Crew: "Unable to retrieve the price for AMZN"
    Crew-->>Script: Return error result
    Script-->>User: Display error message
```

**Key Insight**: The **Task is where the actual user request lives** - it contains the specific instruction to look up a particular stock ticker. The **Agent is generic** - it has access to a stock price tool but doesn't know which stock to look up until it receives the Task. This separation allows you to reuse the same Agent with different Tasks for different stocks or analyses.

**Error Handling**: When the tool raises a `ValueError` for an unknown ticker (like AMZN), the agent is designed to catch the exception and provide a clear error message instead of crashing, demonstrating robust error handling in agent workflows.

### Agent or Tool or Task

In CrewAI, the choice between defining a subagent vs a task depends on the complexity and autonomy needed.

Here's the complete decision framework for **Agent vs Tool vs Task**:

## **Use a `@tool` when:**
- **Single, reusable function** that agents can call on-demand
- **Stateless operations** (API calls, calculations, file I/O)
- You want **agent autonomy** in deciding when/how to use it
- **Composable functionality** that can be chained with other tools
- **Pure functions** with clear inputs/outputs

*Examples: `get_weather()`, `send_email()`, `calculate_distance()`*

## **Use a task when:**
- **Predefined workflow steps** in a sequential pipeline
- **Orchestrating multiple tools/agents** in a specific order
- **Business logic** that shouldn't change based on agent reasoning
- **Error handling and retries** for critical operations
- **Human-in-the-loop** approval steps

*Examples: "Step 1: Validate input â†’ Step 2: Process â†’ Step 3: Send notification"*

## **Use an agent when:**
- **Autonomous decision-making** with reasoning loops
- **Dynamic planning** where the approach isn't predetermined
- **Specialized expertise** requiring different prompts/models
- **Complex multi-step problems** requiring adaptive strategies
- **Maintaining context/memory** across interactions

*Examples: Research agent, code review agent, customer service agent*

## **Common Patterns:**
- **Tools within agents**: Agent uses multiple tools to solve problems
- **Tasks orchestrating agents**: Workflow that routes between specialized agents
- **Agents using agents**: Hierarchical systems with manager/worker agents

**Rule of thumb**: Start with tools, use tasks for orchestration, reserve agents for complex reasoning that needs autonomy.

### Handling Exceptions Improves Outcomes

The book was insistent that `return ValueError("...")` should be used to handle situations where the LLM comes across a failure case.
When running `crewai-tools.py` using a stock ticker that it doesn't know about (`AMZN`), it was easy to see why this is better.
Here's a session:

```sh
Tool Arguments: {'ticker': {'description': None, 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description:
Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.
Raises a ValueError if the ticker is not found.
